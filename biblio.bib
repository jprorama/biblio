  Abstract                 = {Abstract Clustering is a solution for classifying enormous data when there is not any early knowledge about classes. With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using un-supervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

  Abstract                 = {Time plays a key role in recommendation. Handling it properly is especially critical when using recommender systems in real-world applications, which may not be as clear when doing research with historical data. In this talk, we will discuss some of the important challenges of handling time in recommendation algorithms at Netflix. We will focus on challenges related to how our users, items, and systems all change over time. We will then discuss some strategies for tackling these challenges, which revolves around proper treatment of causality in our systems.

One clear way that time impacts recommendations is that users and items change over time. Users and items come and go from a service. Individual user interests also change, which could be someone picking up a new interest or even just people maturing and their tastes changing. Many recommendation approaches are based on historical co-occurrence, in which case they tend to lag with such changes instead of anticipating them. An item that is new to the system may start cold but then develop a lot of interest because it is new. So the level of interest in an item fluctuates across time, which can be additionally impacted by trends such as external events and seasonality.

Beyond these, the system itself changes over time. Feedback loops in the system, where users actions are influenced by the output of the recommendation system, cause the data that the system uses for recommendations to evolve over time. These feedback loops also can degrade the quality of the recommendations because it becomes hard to tease apart when a user is playing something because they enjoy it versus when they are playing it because it was shown prominently. These loops also can make it difficult for new algorithms to be trained and evaluated due to the influence of the production system. Different components of the system also can change over time, which can impact the data seen by other components. Time also becomes a tradeoff for how accurate a model can be against the time it takes to learn or compute recommendations for a certain request. A model giving very promising results offline but taking weeks to learn might be outperformed online by a model with weaker results but more responsive. On the other hand, changing fast may improve online accuracy by being responsive but may also confuse users when everything changes quickly.

Since time is fundamental to the recommendation problem, we seek to optimize our handling of time in our systems. This includes designing experimentation around time by splitting across time and avoiding time-traveling data. It means introducing controlled stochasticity and counterfactuals to break feedback loops and understand causality. It means treating time as a first-class citizen in algorithms. It also means that we often want to optimize our recommendation systems such that a user minimizes the time a user needs to interact with it so that they can find something great to watch.},

  Abstract                 = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique has proven to be promising for implementing large scale recommender systems but its success depends mainly on locating similar neighbors. Due to data sparsity of the user‚Äìitem rating matrix, the process of finding similar neighbors does not often succeed. In addition to this, it also suffers from the new user (cold start) problem as finding possible neighborhood and giving recommendations to user who has not rated any item or rated very few items is difficult. In this paper, our proposed Trust based Ant Recommender System (TARS) produces valuable recommendations by incorporating a notion of dynamic trust between users and selecting a small and best neighborhood based on biological metaphor of ant colonies. Along with the predicted ratings, displaying additional information for explanation of recommendations regarding the strength and level of connectedness in trust graph from where recommendations are generated, items and number of neighbors involved in predicting ratings can help active user make better decisions. Also, new users can highly benefit from pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms as positive feedback in the form of aggregated dynamic trust pheromone defines ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù of a user as recommender over a period of time. The performance of TARS is evaluated using two datasets of different sparsity levels viz. Jester dataset and MovieLens dataset (available online) and compared with traditional Collaborative Filtering based approach for generating recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last 16¬†years, more than 200 research articles were published about research-paper recommender systems. We reviewed these articles and present some descriptive statistics in this paper, as well as a discussion about the major advancements and shortcomings and an overview of the most common recommendation concepts and approaches. We found that more than half of the recommendation approaches applied content-based filtering (55¬†{\%}). Collaborative filtering was applied by only 18¬†{\%} of the reviewed approaches, and graph-based recommendations by 16¬†{\%}. Other recommendation concepts included stereotyping, item-centric recommendations, and hybrid recommendations. The content-based filtering approaches mainly utilized papers that the users had authored, tagged, browsed, or downloaded. TF-IDF was the most frequently applied weighting scheme. In addition to simple terms, n-grams, topics, and citations were utilized to model users' information needs. Our review revealed some shortcomings of the current research. First, it remains unclear which recommendation concepts and approaches are the most promising. For instance, researchers reported different results on the performance of content-based and collaborative filtering. Sometimes content-based filtering performed better than collaborative filtering and sometimes it performed worse. We identified three potential reasons for the ambiguity of the results. (A) Several evaluations had limitations. They were based on strongly pruned datasets, few participants in user studies, or did not use appropriate baselines. (B) Some authors provided little information about their algorithms, which makes it difficult to re-implement the approaches. Consequently, researchers use different implementations of the same recommendations approaches, which might lead to variations in the results. (C) We speculated that minor variations in datasets, algorithms, or user populations inevitably lead to strong variations in the performance of the approaches. Hence, finding the most promising approaches is a challenge. As a second limitation, we noted that many authors neglected to take into account factors other than accuracy, for example overall user satisfaction. In addition, most approaches (81¬†{\%}) neglected the user-modeling process and did not infer information automatically but let users provide keywords, text snippets, or a single paper as input. Information on runtime was provided for 10¬†{\%} of the approaches. Finally, few research papers had an impact on research-paper recommender systems in practice. We also identified a lack of authority and long-term research interest in the field: 73¬†{\%} of the authors published no more than one paper on research-paper recommender systems, and there was little cooperation among different co-author groups. We concluded that several actions could improve the research landscape: developing a common evaluation framework, agreement on the information to include in research papers, a stronger focus on non-accuracy aspects and user modeling, a platform for researchers to exchange information, and an open-source framework that bundles the available recommendation approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Mind-maps have been widely neglected by the information retrieval (IR) community. However, there are an estimated two million active mind-map users, who create 5 million mind-maps every year, of which a total of 300,000 is publicly available. We believe this to be a rich source for information retrieval applications, and present eight ideas on how mind-maps could be utilized by them. For instance, mind-maps could be utilized to generate user models for recommender systems or expert search, or to calculate relatedness of web-pages that are linked in mind-maps. We evaluated the feasibility of the eight ideas, based on estimates of the number of available mind-maps, an analysis of the content of mind-maps, and an evaluation of the users' acceptance of the ideas. We concluded that user modelling is the most promising application with respect to mind-maps. A user modelling prototype -- a recommender system for the users of our mind-mapping software Docear -- was implemented, and evaluated. Depending on the applied user modelling approaches, the effectiveness, i.e. click-through rate on recommendations, varied between 0.28{\%} and 6.24{\%}. This indicates that mind-map based user modelling is promising, but not trivial, and that further research is required to increase effectiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {Recommender systems represent user preferences for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or examine. They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.},

  Abstract                 = {Improving the performance of recommender systems using knowledge graphs is an important task. There have been many hybrid systems proposed in the past that use a mix of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to boost the performance. More recently, some work has focused on recommendations that use external knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement content-based recommendation. In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K. The experiments illustrate that our approaches can give large performance improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate that knowledge graphs give maximum advantage when the dataset is sparse, and gradually become redundant as more training data becomes available, and hence are most useful in cold-start settings.},

This review has been conducted to identify the contextual information and methods used for making recommendations in digital libraries as well as the way researchers understood and used relevant contextual information from the years 2001 to 2013 based on the Kitchenham systematic review methodology. The results indicated that contextual information incorporated into recommendations can be categorised into three contexts, namely users‚Äô context, document‚Äôs context, and environment context. In addition, the classical approaches such as collaborative filtering were employed more than the other approaches. Researchers have understood and exploited relevant contextual information through four ways, including citation of past studies, citation of past definitions, self-definitions, and field-query researches; however, citation of the past studies has been the most popular method. This review highlights the need for more investigations on the concept of context from user viewpoint in scholarly domains. It also discusses the way a context-aware recommender system can be effectively designed and implemented in digital libraries. Additionally, a few recommendations for future investigations on scholarly recommender systems are proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {In the era of big data, recommender system (RS) has become an effective information filtering tool that alleviates information overload for Web users. Collaborative filtering (CF), as one of the most successful recommendation techniques, has been widely studied by various research institutions and industries and has been applied in practice. CF makes recommendations for the current active user using lots of users' historical rating information without analyzing the content of the information resource. However, in recent years, data sparsity and high dimensionality brought by big data have negatively affected the efficiency of the traditional CF-based recommendation approaches. In CF, the context information, such as time information and trust relationships among the friends, is introduced into RS to construct a training model to further improve the recommendation accuracy and user's satisfaction, and therefore, a variety of hybrid CF-based recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this paper, we mainly review and summarize the traditional CF-based approaches and techniques used in RS and study some recent hybrid CF-based recommendation approaches and techniques, including the latest hybrid memory-based and model-based CF recommendation algorithms. Finally, we discuss the potential impact that may improve the RS and future direction. In this paper, we aim at introducing the recent hybrid CF-based recommendation techniques fusing social networks to solve data sparsity and high dimensionality and provide a novel point of view to improve the performance of RS, thereby presenting a useful resource in the state-of-the-art research result for future researchers.},

  Abstract                 = {The amount of content on online music streaming platforms is immense, and most users only access a tiny fraction of this content. Recommender systems are the application of choice to open up the collection to these users. Collaborative filtering has the disadvantage that it relies on explicit ratings, which are often unavailable, and generally disregards the temporal nature of music consumption. On the other hand, item co-occurrence algorithms, such as the recently introduced word2vec-based recommenders, are typically left without an effective user representation. In this paper, we present a new approach to model users through recurrent neural networks by sequentially processing consumed items, represented by any type of embeddings and other context features. This way we obtain semantically rich user representations, which capture a user's musical taste over time. Our experimental analysis on large-scale user data shows that our model can be used to predict future songs a user will likely listen to, both in the short and long term.},

  Abstract                 = {The World Wide Web is moving from a Web of hyper-linked Documents to a Web of linked Data. Thanks to the Semantic Web spread and to the more recent Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative, a vast amount of RDF data have been published in freely accessible datasets. These datasets are connected with each other to form the so called Linked Open Data cloud. As of today, there are tons of RDF data available in the Web of Data, but only few applications really exploit their potential power. In this paper we show how these data can successfully be used to develop a recommender system (RS) that relies exclusively on the information encoded in the Web of Data. We implemented a content-based RS that leverages the data available within Linked Open Data datasets (in particular DBpedia, Freebase and LinkedMDB) in order to recommend movies to the end users. We extensively evaluated the approach and validated the effectiveness of the algorithms by experimentally measuring their accuracy with precision and recall metrics.},

  Abstract                 = {Recommender systems RS are software tools that use analytic technologies to suggest different items of interest to an end user. Linked Data is a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web. This paper presents a systematic literature review to summarize the state of the art in RS that use structured data published as Linked Data for providing recommendations of items from diverse domains. It considers the most relevant research problems addressed and classifies RS according to how Linked Data have been used to provide recommendations. Furthermore, it analyzes contributions, limitations, application domains, evaluation techniques, and directions proposed for future research. We found that there are still many open challenges with regard to RS based on Linked Data in order to be efficient for real applications. The main ones are personalization of recommendations, use of more datasets considering the heterogeneity introduced, creation of new hybrid RS for adding information, definition of more advanced similarity measures that take into account the large amount of data in Linked Data datasets, and implementation of testbeds to study evaluation techniques and to assess the accuracy scalability and computational complexity of RS.

  abstract = {Abstract The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Information Retrieval (IR) systems assist users in finding information from the myriad of information resources available on the Web. A traditional characteristic of IR systems is that if different users submit the same query, the system would yield the same list of results, regardless of the user. Personalised Information Retrieval (PIR) systems take a step further to better satisfy the user's specific information needs by providing search results that are not only of relevance to the query but are also of particular relevance to the user who submitted the query. PIR has thereby attracted increasing research and commercial attention as information portals aim at achieving user loyalty by improving their performance in terms of effectiveness and user satisfaction. In order to provide a personalised service, a PIR system maintains information about the users and the history of their interactions with the system. This information is then used to adapt the users' queries or the results so that information that is more relevant to the users is retrieved and presented. This survey paper features a critical review of PIR systems, with a focus on personalised search. The survey provides an insight into the stages involved in building and evaluating PIR systems, namely: information gathering, information representation, personalisation execution, and system evaluation. Moreover, the survey provides an analysis of PIR systems with respect to the scope of personalisation addressed. The survey proposes a classification of PIR systems into three scopes: individualised systems, community-based systems, and aggregate-level systems. Based on the conducted survey, the paper concludes by highlighting challenges and future research directions in the field of PIR.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known -- a collaboration network and a food web -- and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations.

We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Collaborative filtering systems predict a user's interest in new items based on the recommendations of other people with similar interests. Instead of performing content indexing or content analysis, collaborative filtering systems rely entirely on interest ratings from members of a participating community. Since predictions are based on human ratings, collaborative filtering systems have the potential to provide filtering based on complex attributes, such as quality, taste, or aesthetics. Many implementations of collaborative filtering apply some variation of the neighborhood-based prediction algorithm. Many variations of similarity metrics, weighting approaches, combination measures, and rating normalization have appeared in each implementation. For these parameters and others, there is no consensus as to which choice of technique is most appropriate for what situations, nor how significant an effect on accuracy each parameter has. Consequently, every person implementing a collaborative filtering system must make hard design choices with little guidance. This article provides a set of recommendations to guide design of neighborhood-based prediction systems, based on the results of an empirical study. We apply an analysis framework that divides the neighborhood-based prediction approach into three components and then examines variants of the key parameters in each component. The three components identified are similarity computation, neighbor selection, and rating combination.},

  Abstract                 = {Research outputs across the academic disciplines are almost exclusively published electronically. Organizing and managing these digital resources for purposes of review, and with the technical savvy to do so, are now essential skills for graduate study and life in academia. Paradoxically, digital and web-based technologies provide greater ease and efficiency with which to gather mass amounts of information, while at the same time presenting new challenges for reading, analyzing, organizing, and storing resources. Students, scholars, and the librarians who support them must adopt and refine practices to convert from paper-full to paperless literature review. This article proposes a methodical, reproducible, three-stage process that harnesses the power digital tools bring to the research cycle, regardless of the user's preferred platform or operating system. Focusing just on the literature review phase, we develop a conceptual framework, illustrated with concrete tips and advice for storing and organizing, reading and annotating, and analyzing and writing. We demonstrate how a researcher's self-selected suite of tools may be used to complement and even overcome the limitations of comprehensive academic literature and composition platforms such as Docear and F1000Workspace, especially regarding qualitative data analysis software for analyzing and coding research literature. Using these techniques, librarians can become teachers and research partners supporting the skill development of faculty and students.},

  Abstract                 = {Music recommenders have become increasingly relevant due to increased accessibility provided by various music streaming services. Some of these streaming services, such as Spotify, include a recommender system of their own. Despite many advances in recommendation techniques, recommender systems still often do not provide accurate recommendations. This thesis provides an overview of the history and developments of music information retrieval from a more content-based perspective. Furthermore, this thesis describes recommendation as a problem and the methods used for music recommendation with special focus on content-based recommendation by providing detailed descriptions on the audio content features and content-based similarity measures used in content-based music recommender systems. Some of the presented features are used in our own content-based music recommender. Both objective and subjective evaluation of the implemented recommender system further confirm the findings of many researchers that music recommendation based solely on audio content does not provide very accurate recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {An ever increasing number of social services offer thousands of diverse events per day. Users tend to be overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available, especially with limited browsing options perceived in many event web services. To alleviate this information overload, a recommender system becomes a vital component for assisting users selecting relevant events. However, such system faces a number of challenges owed to the the inherent complex nature of an event. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach built on top of Semantic Web. On the one hand, we use a content-based system enriched with Linked Data to overcome the data sparsity, a problem induced by the transiency of events. On the other hand, we incorporate a collaborative filtering to involve the social aspect, an influential feature in decision making. This hybrid system is enhanced by the integration of a user diversity model designed to detect user propensity towards specific topics. We show how the hybridization of CB+CF systems and the integration of interest diversity features are important to improve predictions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using precision and recall measures.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Recommender systems use past behaviors of users to suggest items. Most tend to offer items similar to the items that a target user has indicated as interesting. As a result, users become bored with obvious suggestions that they might have already discovered. To improve user satisfaction, recommender systems should offer serendipitous suggestions: items not only relevant and novel to the target user, but also significantly different from the items that the user has rated. However, the concept of serendipity is very subjective and serendipitous encounters are very rare in real-world scenarios, which makes serendipitous recommendations extremely difficult to study. To date, various definitions and evaluation metrics to measure serendipity have been proposed, and there is no wide consensus on which definition and evaluation metric to use. In this paper, we summarize most important approaches to serendipity in recommender systems, compare different definitions and formalizations of the concept, discuss serendipity-oriented recommendation algorithms and evaluation strategies to assess the algorithms, and provide future research directions based on the reviewed literature.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research.},

  Abstract                 = {Recommendation algorithms are best known for their use on e-commerce Web sites, where they use input about a customer's interests to generate a list of recommended items. Many applications use only the items that customers purchase and explicitly rate to represent their interests, but they can also use other attributes, including items viewed, demographic data, subject interests, and favorite artists. At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {Background
The analysis of electroencephalograms is often performed in the frequency-domain. These analyses typically involve the computation of spectral power either over pre-defined frequency bands (e.g. theta, delta, alpha, and beta bands) or over a large number of narrow frequency ranges. However, the former technique ignores variability in these frequency bands over time and between participants while the latter ignores the significant redundancy between these powers.
New method
This paper details an unsupervised feature extraction method for EEG data that uses a clustering of features to agglomerate narrow-band spectral powers based on their similarities. This method computes a set of analogues to the traditional frequency bands that are data-driven and participant-specific. A fast correlation-based filter was used to identify which of these agglomerated features were most useful for each investigated classification problem.
Results
The new feature clustering algorithm was used to detect changes in three mental states and to detect the performance of three mental tasks. Balanced classification accuracies approaching or exceeding 70% were attained for all classification problems.
Comparison to existing methods
Classification accuracies attained by this algorithm were compared to those attained by two frequency-domain algorithms that did not employ clustering ‚Äì a wide-band algorithm based on the spectral power within the theta, delta, alpha, and beta bands and a narrow-band algorithm based on the spectral power within 1-Hz ranges. Overall, the feature clustering algorithm was statistically superior to both alternative algorithms.
Conclusions
The new feature clustering algorithm provides a promising alternative to conventional frequency-domain EEG analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Analyzing system logs provides useful insights for identifying system/application anomalies and helps in better usage of system resources. Nevertheless, it is simply not practical to scan through the raw log messages on a regular basis for large-scale systems. First, the sheer volume of unstructured log messages affects the readability, and secondly correlating the log messages to system events is a daunting task. These factors limit large-scale system logs primarily for generating alerts on known system events, and post-mortem diagnosis for identifying previously unknown system events that impacted the systems performance. In this paper, we describe a log monitoring framework that enables prompt analysis of system events in real-time. Our web-based framework provides a summarized view of console, netwatch, consumer, and apsched logs in real- time. The logs are parsed and processed to generate views of applications, message types, individual/group of compute nodes, and in sections of the compute platform. Also from past application runs we build a statistical profile of user/application characteristics with respect to known system events, recoverable/non-recoverable error messages and resources utilized. The web-based tool is being developed for Jaguar XT5 at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing facility.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge Graphs have proven to be extremely valuable to recommender systems, as they enable hybrid graph-based recommendation models encompassing both collaborative and content information. Leveraging this wealth of heterogeneous information for top-N item recommendation is a challenging task, as it requires the ability of effectively encoding a diversity of semantic relations and connectivity patterns. In this work, we propose entity2rec, a novel approach to learning user-item relatedness from knowledge graphs for top-N item recommendation. We start from a knowledge graph modeling user-item and item-item relations and we learn property-specific vector representations of users and items applying neural language models on the network. These representations are used to create property-specific user-item relatedness features, which are in turn fed into learning to rank algorithms to learn a global relatedness model that optimizes top-N item recommendations. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of ranking quality on the MovieLens 1M dataset, outperforming a number of state-of-the-art recommender systems, and we assess the importance of property-specific relatedness scores on the overall ranking quality.},

  Abstract                 = {Recommender systems have become an important research field since the emergence of the first paper on collaborative filtering in the mid-1990s. Although academic research on recommender systems has increased significantly over the past 10years, there are deficiencies in the comprehensive literature review and classification of that research. For that reason, we reviewed 210 articles on recommender systems from 46 journals published between 2001 and 2010, and then classified those by the year of publication, the journals in which they appeared, their application fields, and their data mining techniques. The 210 articles are categorized into eight application fields (books, documents, images, movie, music, shopping, TV programs, and others) and eight data mining techniques (association rule, clustering, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, link analysis, neural network, regression, and other heuristic methods). Our research provides information about trends in recommender systems research by examining the publication years of the articles, and provides practitioners and researchers with insight and future direction on recommender systems. We hope that this paper helps anyone who is interested in recommender systems research with insight for future research direction.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter discusses content-based recommendation systems, i.e., systems that recommend an item to a user based upon a description of the item and a profile of the user's interests. Content-based recommendation systems may be used in a variety of domains ranging from recommending web pages, news articles, restaurants, television programs, and items for sale. Although the details of various systems differ, content-based recommendation systems share in common a means for describing the items that may be recommended, a means for creating a profile of the user that describes the types of items the user likes, and a means of comparing items to the user profile to determine what to re commend. The profile is often created and updated automatically in response to feedback on the desirability of items that have been presented to the user.},

It is often described as a heuristic, and many papers have been written (some based on Shannon's Information Theory) seeking to establish some theoretical basis for it. Some of these attempts are reviewed, and it is shown that the Information Theory approaches are problematic, but that there are good theoretical justifications of both IDF and TF*IDF in the traditional probabilistic model of information retrieval. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents and analyzes an incremental system for clustering streaming time series. The Online Divisive-Agglomerative Clustering (ODAC) system continuously maintains a tree-like hierarchy of clusters that evolves with data, using a top-down strategy. The splitting criterion is a correlation-based dissimilarity measure among time series, splitting each node by the farthest pair of streams. The system also uses a merge operator that reaggregates a previously split node in order to react to changes in the correlation structure between time series. The split and merge operators are triggered in response to changes in the diameters of existing clusters, assuming that in stationary environments, expanding the structure leads to a decrease in the diameters of the clusters. The system is designed to process thousands of data streams that flow at a high rate. The main features of the system include update time and memory consumption that do not depend on the number of examples in the stream. Moreover, the time and memory required to process an example decreases whenever the cluster structure expands. Experimental results on artificial and real data assess the processing qualities of the system, suggesting a competitive performance on clustering streaming time series, exploring also its ability to deal with concept drift.},

  Abstract                 = {Music structure estimation has recently emerged as a central topic within the field of music information retrieval. Indeed, as music is a highly structured information stream, knowledge of how a music piece is organized represents a key challenge to enhance the management and exploitation of large music collections. This paper focuses on the benefits that can be expected from a regularity constraint on the structural segmentation of popular music pieces. Specifically, here, we study how a constraint that favors structural segments of comparable size provides a better conditioning of the boundary estimation process. First, we propose a formulation of the structural segmentation task as an optimization process, which separates the contribution from the audio features and the one from the constraint. We illustrate how the corresponding cost function can be minimized using a Viterbi algorithm. We present briefly its implementation and results in three systems designed for and submitted to the MIREX 2010, 2011, and 2012 evaluation campaigns. Then, we explore the benefits of the regularity constraint as an efficient mean for combining the outputs of a selection of systems presented at MIREX between 2010 and 2015, yielding a level of performance competitive to that of the state-of-the-art on the "MIREX10" dataset (100 J-Pop songs from the RWC database).},

  Abstract                 = {Music recommender systems (MRSs) have experienced a boom in recent years, thanks to the emergence and success of online streaming services, which nowadays make available almost all music in the world at the user's fingertip. While today's MRSs considerably help users to find interesting music in these huge catalogs, MRS research is still facing substantial challenges. In particular when it comes to build, incorporate, and evaluate recommendation strategies that integrate information beyond simple user--item interactions or content-based descriptors, but dig deep into the very essence of listener needs, preferences, and intentions, MRS research becomes a big endeavor and related publications quite sparse. The purpose of this trends and survey article is twofold. We first identify and shed light on what we believe are the most pressing challenges MRS research is facing, from both academic and industry perspectives. We review the state of the art toward solving these challenges and discuss its limitations. Second, we detail possible future directions and visions we contemplate for the further evolution of the field. The article should therefore serve two purposes: giving the interested reader an overview of current challenges in MRS research and providing guidance for young researchers by identifying interesting, yet under-researched, directions in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {This research essay highlights the need to integrate predictive analytics into information systems research and shows several concrete ways in which this goal can be accomplished. Predictive analytics include empirical methods (statistical and other) that generate data predictions as well as methods for assessing predictive power. Predictive analytics not only assist in creating practically useful models, they also play an important role alongside explanatory modeling in theory building and theory testing. We describe six roles for predictive analytics: new theory generation, measurement development, comparison of competing theories, improvement of existing models, relevance assessment, and assessment of the predictability of empirical phenomena. Despite the importance of predictive analytics, we find that they are rare in the empirical IS literature. Extant IS literature relies nearly exclusively on explanatory statistical modeling, where statistical inference is used to test and evaluate the explanatory power of underlying causal models, and predictive power is assumed to follow automatically from the explanatory model. However, explanatory power does not imply predictive power and thus predictive analytics are necessary for assessing predictive power and for building empirical models that predict well. To show that predictive analytics and explanatory statistical modeling are fundamentally disparate, we show that they are different in each step of the modeling process. These differences translate into different final models, so that a pure explanatory statistical model is best tuned for testing causal hypotheses and a pure predictive model is best in terms of predictive power. We convert a well-known explanatory paper on TAM to a predictive context to illustrate these differences and show how predictive analytics can add theoretical and practical value to IS research.},

artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of
sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted
evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several
decades. In contrast, the {AlphaGo} Zero program recently achieved superhuman
performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games
of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single
{AlphaZero} algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in
many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain
knowledge except the game rules, {AlphaZero} achieved within 24 hours a
superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as
well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile devices such as smart phones are becoming popular, and realtime access to multimedia data in different environments is getting easier. With properly equipped communication services, users can easily obtain the widely distributed videos, music, and documents they want. Because of its usability and capacity requirements, music is more popular than other types of multimedia data. Documents and videos are difficult to view on mobile phones' small screens, and videos' large data size results in high overhead for retrieval. But advanced compression techniques for music reduce the required storage space significantly and make the circulation of music data easier. This means that users can capture their favorite music directly from the Web without going to music stores. Accordingly, helping users find music they like in a large archive has become an attractive but challenging issue over the past few years.},

  Abstract                 = {Context-aware recommender systems leverage the value of recommendations by exploiting context information that affects user preferences and situations, with the goal of recommending items that are really relevant to changing user needs. Despite the importance of context-awareness in the recommender systems realm, researchers and practitioners lack guides that help them understand the state of the art and how to exploit context information to smarten up recommender systems. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive systematic literature review we conducted to survey context-aware recommenders and their mechanisms to exploit context information. The main contribution of this paper is a framework that characterizes context-aware recommendation processes in terms of: i) the recommendation techniques used at every stage of the process, ii) the techniques used to incorporate context, and iii) the stages of the process where context is integrated into the system. This systematic literature review provides a clear understanding about the integration of context into recommender systems, including context types more frequently used in the different application domains and validation mechanisms‚Äîexplained in terms of the used datasets, properties, metrics, and evaluation protocols. The paper concludes with a set of research opportunities in this field.},

  Abstract                 = {Among different hybrid recommendation techniques, network-based entity recommendation methods, which utilize user or item relationship information, are beginning to attract increasing attention recently. Most of the previous studies in this category only consider a single relationship type, such as friendships in a social network. In many scenarios, the entity recommendation problem exists in a heterogeneous information network environment. Different types of relationships can be potentially used to improve the recommendation quality. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. Specifically, we propose to combine heterogeneous relationship information for each user differently and aim to provide high-quality personalized recommendation results using user implicit feedback data and personalized recommendation models.

In order to take full advantage of the relationship heterogeneity in information networks, we first introduce meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different types of paths. We then define recommendation models at both global and personalized levels and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the proposed models. Empirical studies show that our approaches outperform several widely employed or the state-of-the-art entity recommendation techniques.},

  title       = {Music Artist Classification with Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks},
  abstract    = {Previous attempts at music artist classification use frame level audio features which summarize frequency content within short intervals of time. Comparatively, more recent music information retrieval tasks take advantage of temporal structure in audio spectrograms using deep convolutional and recurrent models. This paper revisits artist classification with this new framework and empirically explores the impacts of incorporating temporal structure in the feature representation. To this end, an established classification architecture, a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), is applied to the artist20 music artist identification dataset under a comprehensive set of conditions. These include audio clip length, which is a novel contribution in this work, and previously identified considerations such as dataset split and feature level. Our results improve upon baseline works, verify the influence of the producer effect on classification performance and demonstrate the trade-offs between audio length and training set size. The best performing model achieves an average F1 score of 0.937 across three independent trials which is a substantial improvement over the corresponding baseline under similar conditions. Additionally, to showcase the effectiveness of the CRNN's feature extraction capabilities, we visualize audio samples at the model's bottleneck layer demonstrating that learned representations segment into clusters belonging to their respective artists.},

  abstract  = { ABSTRACTAlong with the gradually accelerated urbanization process, simulating and predicting the future pattern of the city is of great importance to the prediction and prevention of some environmental, economic and urban issues. Previous studies have generally integrated traditional machine learning with cellular automaton (CA) models to simulate urban development. Nevertheless, difficulties still exist in the process of obtaining more accurate results with CA models; such difficulties are mainly due to the insufficient consideration of neighborhood effects during urban transition rule mining. In this paper, we used an effective deep learning method, named convolution neural network for united mining (UMCNN), to solve the problem. UMCNN has substantial potential to get neighborhood information from its receptive field. Thus, a novel CA model coupled with UMCNN and Markov chain was designed to improve the performance of simulating urban expansion processes. Choosing the Pearl River Delta of China as the study area, we excavate the driving factors and the transformational relations revealed by the urban land-use patterns in 2000, 2005 and 2010 and further simulate the urban expansion status in 2020 and 2030. Additionally, three traditional machine-learning-based CA models (LR, ANN and RFA) are built to attest the practicality of the proposed model. In the comparison, the proposed method reaches the highest simulation accuracy and landscape index similarity. The predicted urban expansion results reveal that the economy will continue to be the primary factor in the study area from 2010 to 2030. The proposed model can serve as guidance in urban planning and government decision-making. },

  title        = {All Models are Wrong, but Many are Useful: Learning a Variable's Importance by Studying an Entire Class of Prediction Models Simultaneously},
  abstract     = {Variable importance (VI) tools describe how much covariates contribute to a prediction model's accuracy. However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model $f(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{x}^{T}\beta$ with a fixed coefficient vector $\beta$) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.},

  abstract  = {Albeit the implicit feedback based recommendation problem---when only the user history is available but there are no ratings---is the most typical setting in real-world applications, it is much less researched than the explicit feedback case. State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the explicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case if scalability should be maintained. There are few implicit feedback benchmark datasets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback recommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS applies a fast, ALS-based tensor factorization learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero elements in the tensor. The method also allows us to incorporate various contextual information into the model while maintaining its computational efficiency. We present two context-aware implementation variants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to distinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the user history as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usage pattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart product types that are typically purchased repetitively or once. Experiments performed on five implicit datasets (LastFM 1K, Grocery, VoD, and ``implicitized'' Netflix and MovieLens 10M) show that by integrating context-aware information with our factorization framework into the state-of-the-art implicit recommender algorithm the recommendation quality improves significantly.},

  abstract    = {This paper shows that characterizing co-occurrence between events is an important but non-trivial and neglected aspect of discovering potential causal relationships in multimedia event streams. First an introduction to the notion of event co-occurrence and its relation to co-occurrence pattern detection is given. Then a finite state automaton extended with a time model and event parameterization is introduced to convert high level co-occurrence pattern definition to its corresponding pattern matching automaton. Finally a processing algorithm is applied to count the occurrence frequency of a collection of patterns with only one pass through input event streams. The method proposed in this paper can be used for detecting co-occurrences between both events of one event stream (Auto co-occurrence), and events from multiple event streams (Cross co-occurrence). Some fundamental results concerning the characterization of event co-occurrence are presented in form of a visual co- occurrence matrix. Reusable causality rules can be extracted easily from co-occurrence matrix and fed into various analysis tools, such as recommendation systems and complex event processing systems for further analysis.},

  abstract  = {Recommender systems have the effect of guiding users in a personalized way to interesting objects in a large space of possible options. Content-based recommendation systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past. Indeed, the basic process performed by a content-based recommender consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item), in order to recommend to the user new interesting items. This chapter provides an overview of content-based recommender systems, with the aim of imposing a degree of order on the diversity of the different aspects involved in their design and implementation. The first part of the chapter presents the basic concepts and terminology of contentbased recommender systems, a high level architecture, and their main advantages and drawbacks. The second part of the chapter provides a review of the state of the art of systems adopted in several application domains, by thoroughly describing both classical and advanced techniques for representing items and user profiles. The most widely adopted techniques for learning user profiles are also presented. The last part of the chapter discusses trends and future research which might lead towards the next generation of systems, by describing the role of User Generated Content as a way for taking into account evolving vocabularies, and the challenge of feeding users with serendipitous recommendations, that is to say surprisingly interesting items that they might not have otherwise discovered.},

  abstract  = {Are there general principles governing the process by which certain products or ideas become popular relative to other (often qualitatively similar) competitors? To investigate this question in detail, we have focused on the popularity of movies as measured by their box-office income. We observe that the log-normal distribution describes well the tail (corresponding to the most successful movies) of the empirical distributions for the total income, the income on the opening week, as well as the weekly income per theater. This observation suggests that popularity may be the outcome of a linear multiplicative stochastic process. In addition, the distributions of the total income and the opening income show a bimodal form, with the majority of movies either performing very well or very poorly in theaters. We also observe that the gross income per theater for a movie at any point during its lifetime is, on average, inversely proportional to the period that has elapsed after its release. We argue that (i) the log-normal nature of the tail, (ii) the bimodal form of the overall gross income distribution and (iii) the decay of gross income per theater with time as a power law, constitute the fundamental set of stylized facts (i.e. empirical ‚Äòlaws‚Äô) that can be used to explain other observations about movie popularity. We show that, in conjunction with an assumption of a fixed lower cut-off for income per theater below which a movie is withdrawn from a cinema, these laws can be used to derive a Weibull distribution for the survival probability of movies that agrees with empirical data. The connection to extreme-value distributions suggests that popularity can be viewed as a process where a product becomes popular by avoiding ‚Äòfailure‚Äô (i.e. being pulled out from circulation) for many successive time periods. We suggest that these results may apply beyond the particular case of movies to popularity in general.},

Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon craters, wars and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.},

In particular, spatial and temporal structures, which can be found in aggregation and clustering phenomena, are quantified by introducing the concept of cellular automata (CA) measures for homogeneity and for the amount of fluctuations contributing to the observed dynamics. The aim of this paper is to define such measures and then test their performance on theoretically generated data sets. These tests with exemplary spatiotemporal patterns show the applicability of these methods for data analysis. For example, with the help of the CA fluctuation number we are able to extract the amount of noise present in spatiotemporal data. The observables constructed with the help of such CA techniques have straightforward applications in life sciences, where the quantitative analysis of spatiotemporal patterns still suffers from the lack of a standardized set of analysis techniques.},

In the PCA model, each individual (represented by a cell in the lattice) is mainly locally connected to others. We investigate how the topological properties of the random network representing contacts among individuals influence the transient behavior and the permanent regime of the epidemiological system described by ODE and PCA. Our main conclusions are: (1) the basic reproduction number (commonly called R0) related to a disease propagation in a population cannot be uniquely determined from some features of transient behavior of the infective group; (2) R0 cannot be associated to a unique combination of clustering coefficient and average shortest path length characterizing the contact network. We discuss how these results can embarrass the specification of control strategies for combating disease propagations.},

These different values yield a sheaf of increasingly straight lines which together form a cloud of points, being the investigated relation. The theoretical results are tested against the author co-citation relations among 24 informetricians for whom two matrices can be constructed, based on co-citations: the asymmetric occurrence matrix and the symmetric co-citation matrix. Both examples completely confirm the theoretical results. The results enable us to specify an algorithm that provides a threshold value for the cosine above which none of the corresponding Pearson correlations would be negative. Using this threshold value can be expected to optimize the visualization of the vector space.},

Towards this end, a variety of similarity measures have been proposed. However, the relationship between a measure's formula and its performance is not always obvious. A geometric analysis is advanced and its utility demonstrated through its application to six conventional information retrieval similarity measures and a seventh spreading activation measure. All seven similarity measures work with a representational scheme wherein a query and the database objects are represented as vectors of term weights. A geometric analysis characterizes each similarity measure by the nature of its iso-similarity contours in an n-space containing query and object vectors. This analysis reveals important differences among the similarity measures and suggests conditions in which these differences will affect retrieval performance. The cosine coefficient, for example, is shown to be insensitive to between-document differences in the magnitude of term weights while the inner product measure is sometimes overly affected by such differences. The context-sensitive spreading activation measure may overcome both of these limitations and deserves further study. The geometric analysis is intended to complement, and perhaps to guide, the empirical analysis of similarity measures. © 1987 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Therefore, multiple approaches have emerged to construct vectorial representations of structured data, from kernel and distance approaches to recurrent, recursive, and convolutional neural networks. Recent years have seen heightened attention in this demanding field of research and several new approaches have emerged, such as metric learning on structured data, graph convolutional neural networks, and recurrent decoder networks for structured data. In this contribution, we provide an high-level overview of the state-of-the-art in representation learning and embeddings for structured data across a wide range of machine learning fields.},

While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, most existing approaches focus on recommending the most relevant items to users without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, or the company of other people (e.g., for watching movies or dining out). In this chapter we argue that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations. We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. Furthermore, we introduce three different algorithmic paradigms -- contextual prefiltering, post-filtering, and modeling -- for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, discuss the possibilities of combining several contextaware recommendation techniques into a single unifying approach, and provide a case study of one such combined approach. Finally, we present additional capabilities for context-aware recommenders and discuss important and promising directions for future research.},

These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task.},

  abstract  = {In the Internet music scene, where recommendation technology is key for navigating huge collections, large market players enjoy a considerable advantage. Accessing a wider pool of user feedback leads to an increasingly more accurate analysis of user tastes, effectively creating a "rich get richer" effect. This work aims at significantly lowering the entry barrier for creating music recommenders, through a paradigm coupling a public data source and a new collaborative filtering (CF) model. We claim that Internet radio stations form a readily available resource of abundant fresh human signals on music through their playlists, which are essentially cohesive sets of related tracks. In a way, our models rely on the knowledge of a diverse group of experts in lieu of the commonly used wisdom of crowds. Over several weeks, we aggregated publicly available playlists of thousands of Internet radio stations, resulting in a dataset encompassing millions of plays, and hundreds of thousands of tracks and artists. This provides the large scale ground data necessary to mitigate the cold start problem of new items at both mature and emerging services.Furthermore, we developed a new probabilistic CF model, tailored to the Internet radio resource. The success of the model was empirically validated on the collected dataset. Moreover, we tested the model at a cross-source transfer learning manner -- the same model trained on the Internet radio data was used to predict behavior of Yahoo! Music users. This demonstrates the ability to tap the Internet radio signals in other music recommendation setups. Based on encouraging empirical results, our hope is that the proposed paradigm will make quality music recommendation accessible to all interested parties in the community.},

  abstract    = {Evaluation of recommender systems is typically done with finite datasets. This means that conventional evaluation methodologies are only applicable in offline experiments, where data and models are stationary. However, in real world systems, user feedback is continuously generated, at unpredictable rates. Given this setting, one important issue is how to evaluate algorithms in such a streaming data environment. In this paper we propose a prequential evaluation protocol for recommender systems, suitable for streaming data environments, but also applicable in stationary settings. Using this protocol we are able to monitor the evolution of algorithms' accuracy over time. Furthermore, we are able to perform reliable comparative assessments of algorithms by computing significance tests over a sliding window. We argue that besides being suitable for streaming data, prequential evaluation allows the detection of phenomena that would otherwise remain unnoticed in the evaluation of both offline and online recommender systems.},

The task of top-N item recommendation is to predict a ranking of items (movies, books, songs, or products in general) that can be of interest for a user based on earlier preferences of the user. We focus on implicit feedback where preferences are given in the form of binary events/ratings. Differently from state-of-the-art methods, the method proposed is designed to optimize the AUC directly within a margin maximization paradigm. Specifically, this turns out in a simple constrained quadratic optimization problem, one for each user. Experiments performed on several benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods in terms of AUC of the obtained predictions.},

In practice, a large number of ratings from similar users or similar items are not available, due to the sparsity inherent to rating data. Consequently, prediction quality can be poor. This paper re-formulates the memory-based collaborative filtering problem in a generative probabilistic framework, treating individual user-item ratings as predictors of missing ratings. The final rating is estimated by fusing predictions from three sources: predictions based on ratings of the same item by other users, predictions based on different item ratings made by the same user, and, third, ratings predicted based on data from other but similar users rating other but similar items. Existing user-based and item-based approaches correspond to the two simple cases of our framework. The complete model is however more robust to data sparsity, because the different types of ratings are used in concert, while additional ratings from similar users towards similar items are employed as a background model to smooth the predictions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are indeed more robust against data sparsity and give better recommendations.},

This approach is often referred to as neural collaborative filtering (NCF). In this work, we revisit the experiments of the NCF paper that popularized learned similarities using MLPs. First, we show that with a proper hyperparameter selection, a simple dot product substantially outperforms the proposed learned similarities. Second, while a MLP can in theory approximate any function, we show that it is non-trivial to learn a dot product with an MLP. Finally, we discuss practical issues that arise when applying MLP based similarities and show that MLPs are too costly to use for item recommendation in production environments while dot products allow to apply very efficient retrieval algorithms. We conclude that MLPs should be used with care as embedding combiner and that dot products might be a better default choice.},

  abstract  = {In 2006, Netflix announced a $1M prize competition to advance recommendation algorithms. The recommendation problem was simplified as the accuracy in predicting a user rating measured by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). While that formulation helped get the attention of the research community in the area, it may have put an excessive focus on what is simply one of the many possible approaches to recommendations.In this tutorial we will describe different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized ranking, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or search as recommendation. We will use the Netflix use case as a driving example of a prototypical industrial-scale recommender system that has evolved from focusing on rating prediction to full page optimization. We will also review the usage of modern algorithmic approaches that include algorithms such as Factorization Machines [9], Restricted Boltzmann Machines [10], SimRank [7], Deep Neural Networks, or Listwise Learning-to-rank [6, 12, 11].The original recommendation problem was formulated around the existence of explicit user ratings. However, recommender systems can be built using different kinds of data including implicit behavioral data, social connections, or demographics. In this tutorial we will review the usage of different data types and discuss what the availability of Big Data has brought into the research area.Finally, and also related to the availability of large quantities of data, we will talk about how system and architectural decisions play a role in understanding the recommender problem.This tutorial is in part based on recent publications by the author [5, 1, 8, 2, 4, 3].},

  abstract  = { For the past few years most published research on recommendation algorithms has been based on deep learning (DL) methods. Following common research practices in our field, these works usually demonstrate that a new DL method is outperforming other models not based on deep learning in offline experiments. This almost consistent success of DL based models is however not observed in recommendation-related machine learning competitions like the challenges that are held with the yearly ACM RecSys conference. Instead the winning solutions mostly consist of substantial feature engineering efforts and the use of gradient boosting or ensemble techniques. In this paper we investigate possible reasons for this surprising phenomenon. We consider multiple possible factors such as the characteristics and complexity of the problem settings, datasets, and DL methods; the background of the competition participants; or the particularities of the evaluation approach. },
