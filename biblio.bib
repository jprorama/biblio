  Abstract                 = {Abstract Clustering is a solution for classifying enormous data when there is not any early knowledge about classes. With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using un-supervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known -- a collaboration network and a food web -- and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

This article aims to provide an overview of research done on this topic from one of the first mentions of diversity in 2001 until now. The articles ,and research, have been divided into three sub-topics for a better overview of the work done in the field of recommendation diversification: the definition and evaluation of diversity; the impact of diversification on the quality of recommendation results and the development of diversification algorithms themselves. In this way, the article aims both to offer a good overview to a researcher looking for the state-of-the-art on this topic and to help a new developer get familiar with the topic.},

  Abstract                 = { The term‐weighting function known as IDF was proposed in 1972, and has since been extremely widely used, usually as part of a TF*IDF function. It is often described as a heuristic, and many papers have been written (some based on Shannon's Information Theory) seeking to establish some theoretical basis for it. Some of these attempts are reviewed, and it is shown that the Information Theory approaches are problematic, but that there are good theoretical justifications of both IDF and TF*IDF in the traditional probabilistic model of information retrieval. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents and analyzes an incremental system for clustering streaming time series. The Online Divisive-Agglomerative Clustering (ODAC) system continuously maintains a tree-like hierarchy of clusters that evolves with data, using a top-down strategy. The splitting criterion is a correlation-based dissimilarity measure among time series, splitting each node by the farthest pair of streams. The system also uses a merge operator that reaggregates a previously split node in order to react to changes in the correlation structure between time series. The split and merge operators are triggered in response to changes in the diameters of existing clusters, assuming that in stationary environments, expanding the structure leads to a decrease in the diameters of the clusters. The system is designed to process thousands of data streams that flow at a high rate. The main features of the system include update time and memory consumption that do not depend on the number of examples in the stream. Moreover, the time and memory required to process an example decreases whenever the cluster structure expands. Experimental results on artificial and real data assess the processing qualities of the system, suggesting a competitive performance on clustering streaming time series, exploring also its ability to deal with concept drift.},

  Abstract                 = {Music structure estimation has recently emerged as a central topic within the field of music information retrieval. Indeed, as music is a highly structured information stream, knowledge of how a music piece is organized represents a key challenge to enhance the management and exploitation of large music collections. This paper focuses on the benefits that can be expected from a regularity constraint on the structural segmentation of popular music pieces. Specifically, here, we study how a constraint that favors structural segments of comparable size provides a better conditioning of the boundary estimation process. First, we propose a formulation of the structural segmentation task as an optimization process, which separates the contribution from the audio features and the one from the constraint. We illustrate how the corresponding cost function can be minimized using a Viterbi algorithm. We present briefly its implementation and results in three systems designed for and submitted to the MIREX 2010, 2011, and 2012 evaluation campaigns. Then, we explore the benefits of the regularity constraint as an efficient mean for combining the outputs of a selection of systems presented at MIREX between 2010 and 2015, yielding a level of performance competitive to that of the state-of-the-art on the "MIREX10" dataset (100 J-Pop songs from the RWC database).},
