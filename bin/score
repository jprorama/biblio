# implement the overlap score measure, Manning2008, p119.
# 
# compute tfidf of each query term and return the total score
#
# logically it treats each document as a vector with a weight
# for each term in the dictionary.  The weight for that term 
# is summed.
# in this implemntation we compute the weight on the fly and 
# not from a maintain vector represeation.
#
# the implementation maintains efficiency by not treating the
# query terms as a unit vector.
#
# in SMART terms the scoring implements ntb.nnn [Manning2008, 6.4.3]
# by using tf-idf and normalizing by byte size of document.
